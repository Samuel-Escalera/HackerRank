# HackerRank Solutions in C#

Welcome to my **HackerRank Solutions** repository! ðŸ‘‹

This repo contains my solutions to various programming challenges and exercises from the [HackerRank](https://www.hackerrank.com/) platform. I have solved these challenges to enhance my problem-solving skills and deepen my understanding of programming concepts using the **C#** language.

## ðŸ“‚ Project Structure
The solutions are organized in a straightforward way within the `Basic` folder. Hereâ€™s a brief overview:

- **Basic**: Contains fundamental problems that I tackled to practice and improve my coding logic.
    - `FindTheMedian.cs`: Solution to the "Find the Median" challenge.
    - `LonelyInteger.cs`: Solution to the "Lonely Integer" challenge.
    - `MiniMaxSum.cs`: Solution to the "Mini-Max Sum" challenge.
    - `PlusMinusExercise.cs`: Solution to the "Plus-Minus" exercise.
    - `TimeConversion.cs`: Solution to the "Time Conversion" challenge.

## ðŸ’¡ Motivation
I embarked on solving HackerRank challenges to:
- Sharpen my programming skills.
- Develop strong problem-solving strategies.
- Gain confidence in applying C# to solve real-world problems.
- Continuously challenge myself and learn new algorithms and techniques.

## ðŸš€ How to Use
- Feel free to explore the `Basic` folder to review my solutions.
- You can use these solutions as references or study guides, but I highly recommend trying to solve the problems on your own first to maximize learning.
- If you have feedback or suggestions on my code, don't hesitate to reach out!
